            I like reading knowledgable books during my free time. They help me enhance my vocabulary which helps me in Scrabble. Also, instead of wasting time in watching television or doing useless things, I prefer to read books. My favourite author is Sudha Murthy and I like almost every book. Also now I feel that I am only complete if I read books. And, now I am in grade 5 and know that it is a nice habit . Reading helps one be a successful person in life...
